# Project-Guidance: 
### AI-Powered Tech Support Chat Application


This repository contains an AI-powered tech support chat application built using Angular, Angular Material, and [Google Material Design 2](https://m2.material.io/design) principles. The application is designed to assist users with tech support inquiries by leveraging the ChatGPT API to provide initial answers. If ChatGPT is unable to provide a satisfactory response, the inquiry is escalated to human technicians for further assistance. Users can register, log in, ask questions, and receive real-time responses from both the AI and human support staff.
